# SVG-Logo-Generator

## Credits
I used the Stu_Mini-Project from Module 10-OOP of the UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC GitLab as an example.

When I was having trouble using my classes to write a logo.svg file, I consulted ChatGPT and it helped me to implement a switch statement to instantiate the proper shape class (Square, Triangle, or Circle).
