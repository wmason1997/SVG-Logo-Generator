# SVG-Logo-Generator

## Credits
I used the Stu_Mini-Project from Module 10-OOP of the UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC GitLab as an example.

When I was having trouble using my classes to write a logo.svg file, I consulted ChatGPT and it helped me to implement a switch statement to instantiate the proper shape class (Square, Triangle, or Circle).

## Description <a name="description"></a> 
I made this project so that as a freelance web developer I could generate simple SVG logos for my own projects without having to pay a graphic designer. I made it by building a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to an .svg file.
